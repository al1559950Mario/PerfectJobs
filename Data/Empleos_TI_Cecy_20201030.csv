Senior Software Engineer,Remoto - Solo México,Nuvocargo,"Nuvocargo  is reinventing the $2 trillion freight forwarding industry. We are a digital-first freight forwarder using a mix of technology and exceptional service to help companies seamlessly move products across the Americas, starting with the biggest trade lane in the world: Mexico <-> USA cross-border trucking.
  International logistics is the multi-trillion dollar connective tissue of the world economy, but it's been slow to leverage the power of technology; it's finally going digital, and Nuvocargo is playing a big role in driving this historic shift.
  We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals  superpowers  to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone's lives easier.
We’re growing quickly, and are backed by some of the world’s best investors from both Silicon Valley and Latin America such as QED (founders of $60B+ Capital One), NFX (Silicon Valley fund with $10bn in exits), the founders of Nubank ($30B+), Loft ($3B+), Ramp ($2B+), and Rappi ($5B+), ALLVP (Leading Mexico & LatAm fund), Y Combinator (~1% acceptance rate, created $300bn worth of startups), and angels who have built, exited, or currently sit on the board of companies worth over $100 billion.
Our DNA is comprised of four very distinct worlds and cultures: Silicon Valley, Logistics, Latin America, and USA. If you are excited about being at the intersection of these worlds and laying the foundations for hyper-growth at one of the most tech-forward 3PL's in both the US and Mexico, then read on...
  The opportunity for you:
As a Nuvocargo software engineer, you will work with senior members of the engineering and product organization. You will help architect and implement solutions up and down the stack from our front end apps, to our backend API, to our databases and external services.
You will also be part of the landing team that will kickstart our engineering presence in Mexico City. As part of that team you'll help set a high quality bar for engineering and help us bring software best-practices from Silicon Valley to Mexico, making a meaningful impact to the startup ecosystem in Latin America.
Together with rest of the engineering, product, design organization, you will help shape the future of Nuvocargo's tech stack and engineering culture.
Our current stack includes a combination of modern tooling and philosophies:
The front end interfaces include React (including Context and Hooks), Next.js and interactive interfaces via the WhatsApp Business API interfaces and emails.
Our React/Jamstack apps are continuously deployed on Netlify and the internal team workflows and interfaces use a mix of low-code and no-code solutions (think: Airtable, Retool and Zapier) for fast iteration combined with custom front ends for usability, precision and control on certain workflows.
The design and styling processes for our frontend interfaces include Zeplin.io and a component library hosted in React Styleguidist.
We use Rails API, a Postgres database and API integrations with multiple external services for back end development.
We have a strong culture of building quickly and iteratively, deploying features and releases to staging and production multiple times a day.
The products you build will be used by hundreds of Nuvocargo's customers, carriers and users across Nuvocargo's internal teams.
Who are you:
You love deploying features.  One of your favorite feelings is shipping code and releasing new features to users. You know when to accrue technical debt in order to get a feature live. You strive for simple, readable code and you are averse to over-engineering the task at hand (YAGNI).
You have a track record of building great software in fast-growing companies.  You have battle scars and wisdom from many years of building software in ever-changing environments. That wisdom comes both from projects that were incredibly successful and from projects that were abject failures.
You are passionate about making an impact in the Latin American startup ecosystem.  You want to have a direct impact in establishing Nuvocargo's engineering org as one that bridges the gaps between Silicon Valley startups and the Latin American startup ecosystem.
1 + 1 = 3.  You strongly believe that collaboration, pairing, mentoring and raising the bar for everyone on the team makes the team greater than the sum of its parts.
You are a software craftsperson who believes in the journey to mastery.  You believe in creating well crafted software, steadily adding value to stakeholders (as well as the engineering team and your future self) and collaborating with others with an open mind and flexible opinions. You believe that the journey of mastering the craft of software never ends, but you love being along for the ride.
You thrive in a low-friction, light-process environment.  We are not a meeting-heavy org. You are self-motivated to write great software, release great products, pair with team members all without spending hours deliberating whether something is ""3 points"" or ""5 points"".
You are intellectually curious.  You are probably a polyglot when it comes to programming languages (and natural languages), even if you don't have mastery over those other languages. You are always curious to dabble in a new library or framework or language and you analyze their high level pros and cons without even realizing it.
You are both a great communicator and listener.  You are great at synthesizing inputs from different sources; you speak and write clearly, concisely, and with a structure that gets everyone on the same page when things feel messy.
Must haves
Fluent in English.
At least three years of professional experience of developing and deploying production software.
Professional experience in at least one dynamically typed language (JavaScript, Ruby, Python etc).
Personally growth minded.
Nice to haves
Professional experience at a software startup.
Expertise in JavaScript and Ruby (React + Rails, even better!).
Experience mentoring people technically.
Experience building APIs.
What we offer:
A unique & fun culture at the intersection of the freight and technology industries as well as between the USA and Latin American work cultures.
Above market salary and stock options to make you an owner and partner of the business.
The opportunity to shape the foundations of a venture backed technology company aiming to modernize a trillion dollar industry.
A chance to join the ground floor of a well-funded, fast-growing startup that is modernizing an industry critical to the global economy.

Android Engineer (Kotlin),"Guadalajara, Jalisco",Apptegy,"Since our start in 2015, we’ve gone from a group of individuals to a community pushing toward the same goal of building a fantastic company with great people, great products, and, most importantly, a great culture. To date, we have grown to thousands of school districts across the U.S. Apptegy is building products to empower school leaders to run better schools. We have the opportunity to help schools as they go through a radical shift in how they operate and to provide great technology to make that transition.
What we are building:
Apptegy works with thousands of schools and school districts across the United States. For the past 6 years, we’ve been working to make our technology a breath of fresh air. School leaders, superintendents and administrators have some of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world. They are responsible for the safety, well being, and education of thousands of students. Every day they juggle the roles of politician, disciplinarian, visionary, and accountant.
That’s why we focus on simplicity. By making everything simple, we lower the technical barrier so that any administrator can lead with the most powerful tools available.
In short, we are enabling school leaders to brand, market, and strengthen their schools. Amazing events and happenings occur in schools every day and our technology allows that to be shared across web, mobile, social media, and alerts with a single, simple-to-use tool.
As an Android Engineer at Apptegy you will:
Enhance current mobile applications, while also helping to build new ones
Work with other developers of various experience levels
Participate in code reviews and writing technical documentation
Deliver clean and stable code (with tests!)
Be an advocate for tech and engineering inside the company
Experience you should already have: 
Top communication skills for both a technical and non-technical audience.
In-depth experience developing Android mobile applications.
Experience building applications with Kotlin and Java with a desire to learn more about the Android framework.
Success shipping more than one Android app to the Google Play Store.
Experience working on at least one software development team supporting or creating production-ready work.
Experience developing with other languages/frameworks, including but not limited to Dart, Flutter, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, C#, Go, etc. is also nice to have.
What is expected of engineers at Apptegy?
We expect a lot of our engineers. We’ve been able to build an exceptional team that cares about their work and each other. We are incredibly proud of our team. We are also fortunate to have the opportunity to build products, platforms, and features that empower schools and school leaders to highlight their strengths and give the best opportunities to their students. 
Self-driven & Always Learning: At Apptegy, we believe that the right people are intrinsically motivated. We have built a team of engineers that enjoy learning and take that responsibility seriously. Whether they are starting out on their career or well into their experience, they are still looking to improve on their weaknesses and to use their strengths to help others. 
In short, they are naturally motivated to do meaningful work and they own their learning experience. 
To quote one experienced engineer that joined Apptegy in 2020, “People here are like some sort of crack squad of commandos. They are running into what needs doing and doing it. They’re more likely to do too much than too little. This is an excellent team.”
An interest in Culture and Code: We reject the stereotype that engineers want to be left alone to work. In our experience, engineers care deeply about culture, empathy, and enjoying the people they work with. Many of our best engineers were as curious about culture as anyone in People or HR would be. 
We have been able to create a high performing and thoughtful culture across the company and that extends to and is made better by Engineering. That means you get time to do great work and you get to be surrounded by people who care about their work and you.
Speak up: In some companies, engineers have to wait their turn to speak up. You have to have a minimum number of years of experience to have a voice at the table. Or if you’re a senior engineer, you need to hold off until you’ve gained the trust of the veteran engineers. 
At Apptegy, you have a voice from the start. Some of the best ideas have come from junior engineers that see things differently. We want the best ideas to win— no matter who it comes from. And those times when the best idea comes from someone else are an opportunity for you to learn and to increase your learning process.
What is true of you?
An aptitude for challenge & a track record of success:
You have completed a four-year college degree ideally in Computer Science or similar (or without a technical degree, you have experience building successful products and platforms for 5+ years)
You have an impressive track record in your academic and work history.
An ability to manage your day and be effective & efficient:
You have managed your own workflow and schedule. 
You do not need someone to guide your day or tell you what to do next.
What else should I know?
We take our responsibility as a company seriously and aim to make this the best job that you’ve had (and one that sets you up for future success). We want your day at work and your time at home to be a joyful experience that’s why we provide:
Medical insurance for you and dependents
15 days Aguinaldo
Vacation Bonus
Vales de Despensa
Paid Parking
Discretionary/flexible paid time off policy
Paid travel to / from Little Rock, Arkansas (after Covid-19)
If the challenge of building a rapidly growing startup excites you as much as it does us, we hope that you’ll consider joining us.
